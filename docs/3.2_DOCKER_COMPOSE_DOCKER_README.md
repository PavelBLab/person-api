# Docker Compose for Dev Environment 


## **Person API Docker Deployment Guide**

This guide provides a step-by-step process for building, pushing, and deploying a new version of the `person-service` using **Docker** and **Docker Compose** to run both person-api and postgres in docker containers.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure that the following tools are installed and configured:

- **Maven**
- **Docker / Docker desktop**
- **Docker Compose** dependency

---

### **Required Dependency**

To enable the automatic management of Docker Compose within the Spring Boot application, ensure the following dependency is added to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-docker-compose</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
    <optional>true</optional>
</dependency>
```

---

## **Docker Compose for Dev Environment**

1. **File Location:** The `docker-compose-docker.yml` file must be placed in the **root folder** of your project. It contains the configuration for running **Person-Api** and **PostgreSQL**.
2. **PostgreSQL Setup:** PostgreSQL 16.4 runs on `localhost:5480` with persistent data stored in the `postgres_data` Docker volume. The database is initialized using the `init-person-db.sql` script located in the `./dev-scripts/` folder.
3. **Person-Api Setup:** The **Person-Api** runs on `localhost:9090` (mapped from container port `9091`) using the image `pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:latest`. It connects to PostgreSQL using environment variables for database credentials and settings.
4. **Service Dependencies:** The **Person-Api** depends on **PostgreSQL**, ensuring the database service is up before the application starts.
5. **Environment Variables:** The **Person-Api** uses `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev` and PostgreSQL connection details provided via environment variables.

## **Steps to Build, Push, and Deploy**

### **1. Clean and Install Dependencies**

Run the following Maven command to clean and rebuild the project, downloading any updated dependencies:

`mvn clean install -U`

> **Note:** The `-U` flag ensures that all dependencies are updated to the latest versions.

---

### **2. Build the Docker Image**

Build the Docker image for the `person-service` with no caching to ensure that all layers are rebuilt from scratch:

`docker buildx build --no-cache --tag pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:0.1.2 .`

> **Note:** This command creates a new Docker image tagged as `0.1.2` (you can use any version to build an image).

---

### **3. Push the Docker Image to Docker Hub**

After building the image, push it to the Docker Hub registry:

`docker push pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:0.1.2`

> **Important:** Ensure that youâ€™re logged into Docker Hub before running this command and that the version is the same as in the `buildx` command.

---

### **4. Stop and Remove Existing Containers**

Before deploying the new version, stop and remove any running containers defined in the `docker-compose-docker.yml` file:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-docker.yml down`

> This stops and removes the containers but keeps the volume data intact.

---

### **5. Pull the Latest Docker Image**

Ensure that the latest version of the `person-service` image (`0.1.2`) is pulled from Docker Hub:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-docker.yml pull`

> This downloads the updated image from Docker Hub.

---

### **6. Start the Services**

Finally, bring up the services in detached mode using Docker Compose:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-docker.yml up -d`

> This command starts the services defined in the `docker-compose-docker.yml` file, recreating any containers with updated images.

---

## **Summary of Commands**

Here is a summary of the commands you need to run in sequence:

- `mvn clean install -U`
- `docker buildx build --no-cache --tag pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:0.1.2 .`
- `docker push pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:0.1.2`
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose-docker.yml down`
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose-docker.yml pull`
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose-docker.yml up -d`

> **Note:** Following these steps will ensure that the latest version of the `person-service` is correctly built, pushed, and deployed.
