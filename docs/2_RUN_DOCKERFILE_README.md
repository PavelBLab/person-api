# Docker Buildx Command Guide

## Overview

The `docker buildx build` command is used to build Docker images with extended capabilities provided by Docker Buildx. This command allows you to build multi-platform images, leverage advanced caching, and use various build contexts.

## Command Syntax

```
docker buildx build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -
```

**Example Command**
```bash
docker buildx build --tag pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:latest .
```

**Explanation**

* docker buildx build: Invokes the Docker Buildx builder to start the build process. 
* --tag pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:latest. 
* --tag: Specifies a tag to assign to the built image. Tags are used to identify and version your Docker images. 
* pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api: The image name. 
* latest: The tag or version of the image. latest is a common convention used to denote the most recent version of the image. 
* . Represents the build context, which is the path to the directory containing the Dockerfile and the source code to be included in the image. In this case, . refers to the current directory.

**Additional Options**
* --platform: Specify the platforms for which the image should be built. Example: --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64.
* --file or -f: Specify a Dockerfile to use for the build. Example: --file Dockerfile.custom.
* --build-arg: Pass build arguments to the Dockerfile. Example: --build-arg ARG_NAME=value.

**Pushing the Image**

After building the image, you may want to push it to a Docker registry so that it can be used or shared. To do this, you use the docker push command:

```bash
docker push pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:latest
```

**Summary**
1.	Build the Docker Image: The docker buildx build command creates a Docker image from the Dockerfile located in the current directory (.), tags it as pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:latest, and uses Docker Buildx for advanced build features.
2.	Push the Docker Image: The docker push command uploads the tagged image (pavelbr368/abnamro-person-api:latest) to the Docker registry, making it available for distribution and deployment.
